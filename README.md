# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-GUI

About
-----

This is a Tic Tac Toe application that records high scores and was written in C++ with the help of SFML 2.1 on Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express. I wrote this around April of 2014, during my junior year in high school.

While writing this particular application, I experimented with some commenting styles, which explains why some of the comments may seem formatted oddly.

The following YouTube video contains a demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U3oIlrwUyk.

Features
--------

This application's main menu contains two options: one to play, and one to examine the high scores. High scores are based on the amount of moves made by the winning player; that is, the less moves, the better. Admittedly, having high scores for such a game is rather ridiculous, but I wanted to implement the feature for practice. High scores are written to a text file, and the user is notified after he/she creates a new high score.

How to Run
----------

Download the project, unzip the folder, open it with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express, and run it (i.e. click "start debugging"). The SFML files have been locally included.
